Assignment: Time Targeting
The boss is already thinking about the next conference: “Next year I want to make better use of our Google and Facebook advertising. Find out which hours of the day the most people registered, so we can run more ads during those hours.” Interesting!

Ruby has Date and Time classes that will be very useful for this task.
